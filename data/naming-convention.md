## **Tables**

### **Prefixes**

`ud_`: means user define, data contributed by the community.

### Suffixes

`_info` : represents the base information table maintained by Footprint and can be used as a hub for data association

`_daily_stats`. Data in the table are aggregated by day.

`_token_transfers`. Flow records of data chain tokens.

`_transactions`. Represents transaction that occurs on the blockchain, and the hash value represents its uniqueness.

`_deprecated`. Table is no longer relevant.

{% hint style="info" %}
* Same `{table}` may be deprecated several times. Following popular naming convention, the deprecated tables will have the autoincrimenting number appended so that the table name will look like following: `{table}_depecated_{copy_number}`
* Deprecated tables will only be for 30 days. Users having the charts that are based on deprecated tables will be guided to use new updated tables instead
{% endhint %}
