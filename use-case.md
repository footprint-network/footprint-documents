# ðŸ’¡ Use cases

This article will explain some examples and use cases for some of the data on Footprint Analytics. The aim of this article is to help users visualize and understand the possibilities of using our charts and data.

## Charts <a href="#_72prfi9qqxq" id="_72prfi9qqxq"></a>

### [Token](https://www.footprint.network/guest/dashboard/Tokenomics-of-\(Token\)-fp-aa971726-d7a8-4963-8001-a83a4222741e?token\_address=0x26193c7fa4354ae49ec53ea2cebc513dc39a10aa) <a href="#_3o4z98rm4vvl" id="_3o4z98rm4vvl"></a>

The charts in this section are taken from the \_\_ [_Tokenomics of (Token)_ ](https://www.footprint.network/@rogerD/Tokenomics-of-\(Token\)?token\_address=0x26193c7fa4354ae49ec53ea2cebc513dc39a10aa)dashboard. The charts show information on the daily top 10 addresses for Tokens, where you can see data such as the address distribution of token balance and the inflows and outflows of tokens among other things.

### [Address](https://www.footprint.network/guest/dashboard/Address-Analysis-of-GameFi-Project-fp-77828d1e-35bc-4b6c-90e9-7777e7c6902d?gamefi\_name=decentral-games) <a href="#_2jrhe975kffo" id="_2jrhe975kffo"></a>

This chart is from the dashboard[ _Address Analysis of GameFi Project_](https://www.footprint.network/@DeFi360/Address-Analysis-of-GameFi-Project?defi\_name=hundred\_finance), showing new users by month, where you can see the changes of the daily average of new users by month as well as new users by month.

This chart is from the dashboard of _Chain Overview_, showing the number of protocols by chain.

### [GameFi](https://www.footprint.network/guest/dashboard/Ethereum-GameFi-Tracker-fp-60abcc01-61e2-4daf-9f90-1cf4d30e9b28?chain=Ethereum\&date\_filter=past30days) <a href="#_gu57b4mu338c" id="_gu57b4mu338c"></a>

This chart is from the dashboard of [_Ethereum GameFi Tracker_](https://www.footprint.network/@KikiSmith/Ethereum-GameFi-Tracker?chain=Ethereum\&date\_filter=past30days\&protocol\_type=GameFi), showing the ranking of daily gamers, where you can see their game logo, their protocol slugs, the volume of active users, new users and more.

## Dashboards <a href="#_ul3ua6yxygr0" id="_ul3ua6yxygr0"></a>

### Project <a href="#_4xyszc1sohqy" id="_4xyszc1sohqy"></a>

Project Dashboards allow you to easily assemble data on your favorite project in one place. Having all these stats in one place greatly helps to manage your project and help it succeed.

One example we will be going through for this section is the Curve Dashboard.

Exampleï¼š[Curve Dashboard](https://www.footprint.network/guest/dashboard/Curve-Dashboard-fp-9f4d30ce-9676-43a9-bf31-2712632b4bf1?days=past3months\~\&name=curve\&chain=Ethereum\&chain=Fantom\&chain=xDai\&chain=Polygon\&chain=Arbitrum\&chain=Avalanche\&chain=Harmony\&pool=3pool)

This is a dashboard about Curve, in which all of the important metrics have been assembled in one place. We can see that the creator is showing us a few at a-glance counters, which tell us the most important information in simple numbers.

### Sector <a href="#_1gxuova099h4" id="_1gxuova099h4"></a>

Sector Dashboards allow you to glance at an entire sector of our new Economy and analyze what's happening in real time. The example we will be looking at here is the DEX Industry Dashboard.

Exampleï¼š[DEX Industry Dashboard](https://www.footprint.network/guest/dashboard/DEX-Industry-Dashboard-fp-4934074b-d945-4ddd-b818-829cb37947e8?date=past60days)

This is a dashboard about the DEX industry. It includes an analysis of Volume and Number of Transactions.

### Ecosystem <a href="#_n0lv613tob6" id="_n0lv613tob6"></a>

Since Footprint Analytics has all the data in one place, you can also check more general metrics, such as the Polygon Dashboard.

Exampleï¼š[Polygon Dashboard](https://www.footprint.network/guest/dashboard/Polygon-Dashboard-fp-9aefaa6b-c76c-4672-a572-cfbf3e92b935?date\_filter=2021-04-30\~)

This is the dashboard about Polygon, in which you can also check general metrics such as TVL and Market Cap.

### DeFi **Adoption**

Footprint Analytics has compiled the user numbers of all important DeFi Protocols and compiled them in one Dashboard, such as the DeFi Data Analytics Dashboard.

Exampleï¼š[DeFi Data Analytics Dashboard](https://www.footprint.network/@SimonJohnson/DeFi-data-analytics-Footprint-Network?days=past30days\&name=curve)

This is the dashboard about DeFi Data Analytics, in which you can also check general metrics such as TVL and Transaction.
