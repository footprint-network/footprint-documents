# Tables

Tables are often what you need when you’re working with a lot of fields. The table visualization in Footprint Analytics comes packed with features. We will be exploring some frequently used and practical functions of data visualization. Data visualization is an efficient way of communicating the graphic representation of data through the use of various charts.
