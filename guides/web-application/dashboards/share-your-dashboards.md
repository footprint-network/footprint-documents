# Share

After saving your charts or dashboards, Footprint Analytics makes it easy for users to share your work with others.

### Sharing Your Work <a href="#_3h49oa8whlp3" id="_3h49oa8whlp3"></a>

All of the charts and dashboards you create are shareable to those with and without Footprint accounts via link. To share your work:

Step 1: Click on the **Share icon** in the upper right corner of your screen. You can choose the way you want to share your chart with additional settings.

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/0 (4)>)

The image above shows users where the share icon is once you’ve accessed your desired chart or dashboard.

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/1 (10) (1)>)

The gif above demonstrates the first step to sharing your charts and dashboards based on Step 1.

_**Note**: Dashboards and charts are not shareable in editing mode. Ensure you have saved your work before sharing it._

Step 2: Choose either **Public link** or **Public embed**. The descriptions can be found in the image below. Once you have chosen one, click on the **Copy icon** to the right of the link. Make sure you paste the link where you would like it before copying anything else. You can even share via any of the four social media platforms Facebook, Twitter, Telegram or LinkedIn by clicking on their respective **logos**.

### Setting What You’re Sharing <a href="#_xk96n5zgzpw1" id="_xk96n5zgzpw1"></a>

You can set your charts and dashboards to private for when you prefer keeping your work to yourself.

Click on the button under **Set to private** to activate the feature, setting this particular chart or dashboard to private. The rest of your charts and dashboards are still public to the Footprint Analytics community, making them visible and usable for other members that may search for topics relating to your title.

The image above shows where the Set to private button is.

_**Note**: The privacy option is only available for membership holders._

### Removing Watermarks <a href="#_2i0gzxj8gsjs" id="_2i0gzxj8gsjs"></a>

Watermarks are removable with the option found under the Set to private feature. To activate, just click the button next to the text Remove watermark.

Note: _The Remove Watermark function is only available for membership holders._

The image above shows users what the Remove watermark option looks like.
