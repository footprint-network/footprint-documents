# ðŸ¤– API

Footprint provides two kinds of APIs. Data API allows you to get data using programmatic methods to later use it in your own products. The interactive documentation has been moved to a separate project, available at the following link:

&#x20;We also support the [api.md](../../api/api.md "mention") that allows to programmatically upload data to the platform.
