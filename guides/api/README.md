# ðŸ¤– API

## Introduction

Footprint Analytics has launched an API that allows developers and blockchain companies to track whales, NFT collections, GameFi data, and more, from 17 chains. The API allows developers to make calls from a database of structured data encompassing multiple protocols with a single query or easily customize the data API when needed.&#x20;

We are working on two types of API at the same time - REST API and GraphQL. The API's Rest API makes it very simple and fast to integrate, while its data API also supports GraphQL. You can customise your data results without waiting for any further development.

Letâ€™s consider a simple scenario: analysis of the NFT collection. You want to get the result of Foundation's sale trades and contract address from Opensea on Ethereum. When using a rest API, it takes 2 API calls to get the collectionâ€™s metadata and transactions.  With GraphQL, a single query gets your back when it comes to returning predictable results- the data you get is exactly what you need, nothing more and nothing less. It greatly improves the efficiency of data acquisition.
