## Features

### Github repo renamed

We have decided to rename our repository containing the code for our main web application. We believe that the new name fully reflects the content of the repository.

Along with updating the repository name, there were also changes at the infrastructure level, which we also performed.

## Bugs fixed

### Sorting on my profile

We had errors sorting different entities within a personal profile. Now we have fixed them and the display order should be correct.
