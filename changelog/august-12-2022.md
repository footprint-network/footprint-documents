## New Features

### Refresh `Dashboard` and `Chart`

To improve the speed of queries, data from `Dashboard` and `Chart` is cached, which is useful, but this can cause results to be not up to date. Now it is possible to click on `Refresh cache` to get the latest query results.

### Download `Chart` Data

Not only the details page of each `Chart`, but now you can also download `Chart` data directly in `Dashboard`, isn't it super convenient!

But that's not enough, you don't even need to save the Chart to download it directly!

## New Data

`defi_protocol_daily_stats` has been updated and the table structure has been redesigned to remove some redundant columns and to optimise the naming of the columns to make them more standardised.

For dashboards and charts that used defi\_protocol\_daily\_stats before the update we have done some automatic updates, but some of the removed fields still need to be replaced. We apologise for the inconvenience.
