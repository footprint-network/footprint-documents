## New Features

### Replace to upgraded table

Table upgrades help with metrics exploration, and if you're using outdated or deprecated `Tables`, you can now see a prompt in `My Profile` that you need to replace them.

### Enhanced dashboard and chart caching performance

As Footprint gets more data and users, we're working on improving the loading speed of `Dashboard` and `Chart`, and it's already working, but it's getting better.

## Bug Fixed

### Popover button is not clickable

When adding a `Filter` and setting the `Default Value`, always failed to click the `Add` button, now it's good.

### No redirection after the dashboard is deleted

Now after deleting the `Dashboard` `My Profile` view will be opened.
