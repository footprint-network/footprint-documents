## New Features

### Pricing Plan

Footprint goes live in August 2021. It's been a year since it went live, and in the past year we've done a lot of great work

* 17 chains have been parsed
* From a T-1 Day data update frequency to a current Chain data update frequency of every 3 hours
* We parsed GameFi's data, and user analysis is our featured metric
* We added more NFT data, covering 10 marketplaces of 3 chains
* API is now available, besides uploading data, you can also download data via API
* We upgraded our architecture to support more and faster queries
* The python solution became available to users, providing analysts with another option for data analysis: [Link](https://docs.footprint.network/guides/jupiter-notebook)
* We started to roll out enterprise plans for data customization and usage.

All this work makes Footprint a better product. Along with the product and service upgrades, we have changed our pricing plan to reflect the services our customers need the most for those who have previously subscribed, you will automatically be upgraded to the latest Business plan, so you don't have to worry about it.If you have any questions about the [new pricing plan](https://www.footprint.network/pricing) or anything at all, please donâ€™t hesitate to reach out anytime via sales@footprint.network or contact us on discord channel.
